Get runtime permissions on Android quickly and easily.ðŸ˜Ž

## About Fork
This is Android library for get runtime permissions quickly and easily. I hard forked in Kotlin to make it easier and faster to use. So I refactored and replaced it with simpler, more intuitive code. This code was forked in [Raphaelbussa's PermissionUtils](https://github.com/raphaelbussa/PermissionUtils), which helped to set up the concept and basic structure of the library. It does not provide all of the features provided by the original, and provides simpler functionality.

## How to
To get a Git project into your build:

**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```Gradle
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency
```Gradle
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.khkong:PermissionUtils:1.0.0-alpha1'
	}
```
## Sample code

**Step 1.** Create `PermissionManager::class`

`setRetry()` and `setRequestCode()` are optional. Default request code is *100*.

```Kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var permissionManager: PermissionManager

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
	
        permissionManager = PermissionManager.Builder()
            .addPermission(
                Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
                Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION,
                Manifest.permission_group.CAMERA
            )
            .setRetry(2)
            .setRequestCode(100)
            .whenAllPass {
                doNextProcess()
            }
            .whenDenied { deniedPermissions, foreverDeniedPermissions ->
                goCustomPageForPermissionRequest()
            }
            .build()
    }
}
```

**Step 2.** Call `PermissionManager.request()`
```Kotlin
    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        permissionManager.request(this)
    }
```

**Step 3.** Override `onRequestPermissionsResult()`. and call `PermissionManager.handleResult()`

just insert a single line of code!

```Kotlin
    override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<out String>, grantResults: IntArray) {
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
        permissionManager.handleResult(this@MainActivity, requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
    }
```

**Little extra**. You can also take the following actions when user checked *Don't ask again*

So, You will be taken to the application settings screen.
```Kotlin
            .whenDenied { deniedPermissions, foreverDeniedPermissions ->
		if(foreverDeniedPermissions.isNotEmpty(){
			PermissionManager.openApplicationSettings(this, application.packageName)
		}
            }
```
